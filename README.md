LendingClub Customer Analytics

Established in 2006, LendingClub was an American peer-to-peer (P2P) lending company that links borrowers to investors. Due to its affordability and accessibility, P2P lending platforms have seen a rise in credit demand over the past few years. With the rise in credit demand came a rise in borrowers defaulting on their loans. As LendingClub profits by charging both borrowers and investors a fee, the high defaulting rate would discourage investors from using the platform, leading to a loss in profits.

My group's objective is to maximise LendingClub profits by decreasing losses via measures to prevent default among high default risk borrowers, and to increase profits by encouraging low default risk borrowers to take up more loans.

Some parameters that we found to have valuable insights included:
  1. Debt to income ratio
  2. Number of open accounts
  3. Annual income of a user
  4. Home ownership of users
  5. Subgrade of loan - credit rating given by LendingClub

I further split and compared these categories against each other, to derive even more interesting findings, for example: finding the rate of charged off loans based on income split by the type of Home Ownership of the users.

My group and I then included recommendations as to what LendingClub could take on to increase their profits by pinpoiting potentially high default users that we have analysed.

I've attached the html file of my project code, as well as the report findings in a pdf format!
