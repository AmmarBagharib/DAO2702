LendingClub Customer Analytics

Established in 2006, LendingClub was an American peer-to-peer (P2P) lending company that links borrowers to investors. Due to its affordability and accessibility, P2P lending platforms have seen a rise in credit demand over the past few years. With the rise in credit demand came a rise in borrowers defaulting on their loans. As LendingClub profits by charging both borrowers and investors a fee, the high defaulting rate would discourage investors from using the platform, leading to a loss in profits.

My group's objective is to maximise LendingClub profits by decreasing losses via measures to prevent default among high default risk borrowers, and to increase profits by encouraging low default risk borrowers to take up more loans
